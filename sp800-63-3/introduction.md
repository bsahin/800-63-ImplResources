The revised 800-63-3 guidelines instruct federal agencies to apply their existing risk management processes to determine their levels of identity-related risks associated with their online services.

800-63-3 instructs agencies to apply their risk management processes to their various online services to determine their Identity Assurance Level, Authenticator Assurance Levels, or Federation Assurance Levels, and then implement the provided controls accordingly. While the requirements tell federal agencies what they must do, they lack specific guidance about how to do this. The purpose of the resources and tools provided herein, then, is to assist agencies in applying risk assessment activities to determine their level of identity-related risk associated with an online service. 

NIST has developed an Identity Risk Assessment Process Flow to guide agencies through the risk assessment process, providing additional resources for each step in the process. Each agency is required, per 800-63-3, to produce a digital identity acceptance statement, so NIST has provided a template for agencies to adapt to meet their own needs. As the identity risk assessment process is related to the Risk Management Framework (RMF), more information is provided to highlight the relationship between the two. 

If your agency has recommendations for additional resources or tools related to 800-63-3, please visit the Contribute page.
