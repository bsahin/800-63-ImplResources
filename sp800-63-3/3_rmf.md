The NIST SP 800-63-3 requirements include a section regarding Digital Identity Risk Management. It is important to note that the document does not establish additional risk management processes for agencies, but rather, it supplements the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and its component special publications. SP 800-63-3 requirements provide specific guidance related to digital identity risk that must be applied through the execution of RMF life cycle phases. 

According to the NIST Risk Management Framework overview, the management of organizational risk is a vital part of an agencyâ€™s information security program and provides an effective framework for selecting appropriate security controls for a system, which in turn helps protect individuals and the operations and assets of an agency. The Risk Management Framework, a risk-based approach to security control selection, provides a process that integrates security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle.

Although the RMF is designed to look at organizational risk on a broad scale, it can be applied at a smaller scale to digital identity risk management. Agencies can apply the concepts of identity risk management and the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-63-3 around risk assessment frameworks to the steps outlined in the RMF when developing, implementing, and maintaining their identity risk management programs. The risk assessment methodology outlined in this document can be considered Step 0 of the RMF process, as it is a precursor to selecting, implementing, assessing, and monitoring controls. Nonetheless, the methodology follows a similar process pattern as the RMF, with each step in the risk assessment methodology correlating to a step in the RMF. For example, agencies identify potential risks, categorize them by impact level, select assurance levels, and implement risk treatment decisions.

The following table outlines the six RMF steps to managing organizational risk and the corresponding relevant identity risk management activities associated with each RMF step.

**Table: Risk Management Life Cycle and Activities**

| **Step** | **Description** | **Corresponding Identity Risk Management Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 0: Conduct Risk Assessment** |	Conduct a risk assessment to determine the extent to which risk must be mitigated by the identity proofing, authentication, and federation processes. |	Conduct a risk assessment to determine the extent to which risk must be mitigated by the identity proofing, authentication, and federation processes. |
| **Step 1: Categorize System** |	Categorize the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis. |	Identify appropriate identity assurance level(s) based on risk assessment and other analysis. |
| **Step 2: Select Controls** |	Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on agency assessment of risk and local conditions.	 |	Select identity proofing process and technologies. Select authenticators and authentication controls. Select federation protocols and controls. |
| **Step 3: Implement Controls** | Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and environment of operation.  |	Implement select controls and authenticators. |
| **Step 4: Assess Controls** |	Assess the security controls using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. |	Assess selected controls. |
| **Step 5: Authorize System** |Authorize system operation based upon a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation of the system and the decision that this risk is acceptable. |	Codify identity risk management decisions in a Digital Identity Acceptance Statement and other documentation. |
| **Step 6: Monitor Controls** | Monitor and assess selected security controls in the system on an ongoing basis including assessing security control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to appropriate agency officials. |	Monitor and assess selected controls on an ongoing basis and make updates as necessary. |
